# 👋 Hi, I'm Aman

I'm a **Computer Science student and full-stack developer** who enjoys building **real-time, collaborative web applications**.  
I like working close to the system level of the web, where things update instantly, scale cleanly, and feel smooth to use.

## 🚀 What I'm Currently Working On

- 🧑‍💻 A **real-time coding & learning platform**

- 🧠 Improving **system design, state management, and clean architecture**
